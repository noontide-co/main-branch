# Main Branch

Git-native business OS. Free skills for capturing research and decisions to markdown files. The paper trail that compounds.

## Installation

```bash
claude /plugin install main-branch
```

## Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `research-capture` | Save AI research to dated markdown files |
| `decision-capture` | Record business decisions with full context |

## Quick Start

After installing, try:

```
/research-capture "What is the paper trail method?"
/decision-capture "We're using GitHub for premium distribution"
```

Check `research/` and `decisions/` folders for output.

## Templates

### CLAUDE.md Template
- `templates/CLAUDE.md.template` - Starter CLAUDE.md for your projects

### Business OS Scaffold
Copy `templates/core/` to start a new project with the paper trail structure:

```
templates/core/
├── CLAUDE.md        → The brain (business context for Claude)
├── research/        → AI research, captured with sources
├── decisions/       → Business decisions with reasoning
├── processes/       → Recurring workflows, refined over time
└── solved/          → Problems figured out (don't re-solve)
```

Each folder has a README explaining what goes there.

## The Philosophy

Each unit of work should make subsequent units easier—not harder.

When you research something, capture it. When you make a decision, record it. Tomorrow, Claude remembers. The paper trail compounds.
